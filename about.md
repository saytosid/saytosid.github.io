I am a 3rd year B.Tech CSE student at IIT Mandi. My interests lie in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I like the idea of having machines that can do stuff that I thought only humans were capable of, simple things like image classifiers and game playing bots got me excited about ML in my 5th semester.

Clicked by me at Triund, Dharamshala. More clicks at my [500px profile](http://500px.com/saytosid "Siddhant Kumar | 500px")  
I like travelling to new places and exploring different kinds of lives people live. My dream vacation would be a long bike trip arround the boundry of the country :)  
I played Hockey for a brief time in my college team as right out defender.
