I am a 3rd year B.Tech CSE student at IIT Mandi. My interests lie in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I like the idea of having machines that can do stuff that I thought only humans were capable of, simple things like image classifiers and game playing bots got me excited about ML in my 5th semester.

I like travelling to new places and exploring different kinds of lives people live. My dream vacation would be a long bike trip arround the boundry of the country :)  
I played Hockey for a brief time in my college team as right out defender.
