I am a Software Engineer at Bloomberg LP, London. I am quite fascinated with CS and have always been curious about the new developments in the area. I pursued ML research for 2 years at university, at Bloomberg I work with Bond pricing and Yield curves. Apart from work, I am studying Quantitative Finance at CQF.  
### In other life
I am a hobbist Photographer who likes to trek in the beautiful Himalayas where my university was. I am a Nikon fanboy and have used their cameras since the COOLPIX L3. Currently I use a D750 with 24-120 F4 lens. Now that I live in London I cant trek in the Himalayas anymore, but London is a beautiful city and I have been exploring a lot of street/urban photography here.
